# Phone Calculator (Python Tkinter)

A fully functional scientific calculator desktop application built with Python's Tkinter library. Designed to replicate the look and behavior of a smartphone calculator with extended scientific functions.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)
- Scientific functions including square root, square, cube, reciprocal, sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm (log10), and natural logarithm (ln)
- Parentheses support for complex expressions
- Toggle positive/negative sign
- Backspace and clear input operations
- Real-time display of expression and results with large, clear digital-style font
- Responsive grid layout with color-coded numeric, operator, and function buttons resembling modern Android calculators
- Error handling for invalid inputs or operations (e.g., division by zero)

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. This project uses only the Python standard library (Tkinter and math modules), so no external dependencies are required.
3. Download or clone the project files.

## Usage

Run the application by executing:


The GUI window opens showing the calculator interface ready for input. Use the mouse or keyboard to interact with buttons, enter numbers and operations, then press "=" to evaluate.

## Code Structure

- `calculator.py` contains all logic and UI code:
  - Functions implement calculator logic and scientific operations.
  - Tkinter widgets define the display and buttons with color-coded themes.
  - Event-driven callbacks tie button presses to appropriate functions.
  - Grid-based layout ensures a flexible, neat interface.

## Contributing

Contributions and improvements (e.g., additional functions, improved UI) are welcome via pull requests.


Designed and coded for simplicity and educational purposes, showcasing Python GUI programming with Tkinter and basic scientific math functions.
